\section{Sub-domain Modelling for Dialogue Management with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning [Jason]}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses options for multi-domain dialogue management
    \item Gaussian processes are used for function approximation
    \item Policies are able to call temporally extended sub tasks
    \item Option has $\langle \pi , \beta ,  I \rangle$ where $\pi$ is a policy, $\beta$ is
          a termination condition and $I$ is an input set of states where the option is available
    \item semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) allows actions to take a variable amount of time to complete
    \item Pseudo-rewards are used to train subdomains using an internal critic which determines if
          the sub-goal has been reached
    \item They apply this method to the problem of booking a resturant or a hotel. The subdomains in this
          are booking and payment.
    \item HRL apprach learns more quickly and has a higher return than the flat approach
\end{itemize}
