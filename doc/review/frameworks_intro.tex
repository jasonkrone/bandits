\section{Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Frameworks}
In this section we discuss the four main frameworks used in hierarchical
reinforcement learning. These frameworks are Options, Hierarchical Abstract Machines,
MAX-Q, and Feudal Reinforcement Learning. We begin by discussing the Options,
which is most commonly used in recent work, and subsequently describe the
remaining frameworks in the order given above.
